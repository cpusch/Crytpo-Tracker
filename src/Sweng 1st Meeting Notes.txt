Recommender system using python ai/ml

build recommender system 

Data about customers business are interested in is how many
	of the customers are not using recourses/not taking advantage of the platform
	what type of people are using the business what customers are leaving the platform
	
	What customers are stagnant(signed up but did not use the system)
	something is wrong with the platform
	
	How many customers are churning what indicators tell me what groups
	are looking promissing and what group should i be worried about.
	

Soul of project is recommendation system cloud vendor
	for example to build a website you need a good amount of products to build it out
	
	if one customer is using a lot of recources and a new custoemr is using a few of the
	same products you can recommend other products to them that they might need
	
	if you know that there are a lot of products that people use together you can find
	those and bundle them and sell more of them. Sell as much as you can since the proffit
	margins are lower. 
	
	One the customer is on your platform they can't really leave your platform. 
	
Part 1. Create clustering solution so you can cluster the customers that are not using the solution
		and other customers that are promissing and using the solution
		
Part 2. If you know the customers that will churn or not churn you can build a	
		recommender system that if you know if a customer is using a certain products	
		you can sell them the other products as a recommendation on the dashboard
		
Part 3. Create a visualization dashboard in order to show what is happening

Put code on github

find datasets on gaggle, uci university

churning defined by amount of money they spend
